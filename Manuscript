Offline Speech



We have something to say since a (very) long time. (Break)



/* With very or without?



It is about the feeling we all have inside of us. (Break)



We want a better future for our world.



We donâ€™t want to spend our lives in offices, factories and on highways

/* Must be formulated positively and maybe belongs in another part

/* Maybe the part where we say how a well designed future looks to us



But we must decide for this future. (Break)



Where we just work enough to provide the food and the energy we need and the rest of the time we can be creative, 

we can love and we can support the weak, the young, the sick and the old.

/* Must be formulated more precisley and maybe belongs in another part

/* Maybe the part where we say how a well designed future looks to us



Success never comes through wishing



If you wish for a million dollars it will not come

/* This is a bad example maybe a better example needs to be defined

/* Maybe the part where we say how a well designed future looks to us



But with definite plans. (Break)



If you will make definite plans how to gain a million dollar

/* This is a bad example maybe a better example needs to be defined

/* Maybe the part where we say how a well designed future looks to us



Followed by actions and persistence.



You will get it

/* This is a bad example maybe a better example needs to be defined

/* Maybe the part where we say how a well designed future looks to us 



If we want to reach our dreams and future goals

First of all, we must define them



Let us design our path together

Let us make things priority that matter most

Let us set reachable goals

Let us set direction towards a designed and better future



Planet Earth.
